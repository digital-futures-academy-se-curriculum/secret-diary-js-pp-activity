## Problem Statement

DFCorp is a company that makes a secret diary.  The diary has a lock and can only be accessed by entering the correct pin number.  When the user enters the correct pin number, the diary is unlocked and can be used - i.e. all entries can be viewed and new entries can be made.  When they enter the incorrect pin number, the diary stays locked and they cannot access it.  The diary should also be able to be locked.  DFCorp would like you to create a console application that simulates this behaviour as a prototype for an electronic version of the diary.

## Task 1

- From the Problem Statement above, create User Stories to describe the required functionality of the Secret Diary
- With these User Stories, create a Kanban board to track your progress through the project
- From the User Stories, identify the Objects and Messages that will make up the system and generate Domain Models
  - Ensure that you are following the *Single Responsibility Principle* for each block of code
- Test-Drive the creation of the prototype based on your User Stories

## Notes

You will need to set up your testing framework (preferably **Jasmine**), initialising an `npm` project with `npm init` and installing the appropriate packages.
